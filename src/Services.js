          Director of the Ackerman Institute’s Social Work & Diversity Program
          Silvia B. Espinal, LCSW is Director of the Latinx Youth and Family
          Immigration Project, a clinic supervisor, and Director of the Ackerman
          Institute’s Social Work & Diversity Program. Silvia began her family
          therapy training while she was a graduate student at NYU Silver School
          of Social Work and an intern in the Social Work and Diversity Program.
          Her interest in family and couple therapy persisted, and she proceeded
          to complete Ackerman’s post-graduate externship program.  In 2021,
          Silvia joined Laurie Kaplan as Co-Director of the Social Work and
          Diversity Program. Silvia is the first Social Work and Diversity
          Program graduate to become a co-director, an honor she is committed to
          extend to other graduates of the program.  In 2014, Silvia co-created
          the Ackerman Institute’s Latinx Youth and Family Immigration Project.
          The project offers therapy for Latinx families and community training
          to partner agencies working with immigrant populations. As a Latina
          immigrant herself, Silvia believes the Social Work and Diversity
          Program provided a community and opportunities as a Latina immigrant
          to strengthen her skills supporting BIPOC communities.  Silvia is
          currently an adjunct faculty at the School of Social Work at Columbia
          University and Smith College. Additionally, to her professional
          training at Ackerman, Silvia completed a two-year group supervision
          training at the Eikenberg Institute for Relationships in NYC where she
          focused on the integration of diversity and issues of social justice
          with clinical cases.  As a Latina immigrant and a family therapist,
          Silvia’s biculturalism and bilingualism have helped her grow a genuine
          and unique passion in the immigrant experience and she uses this
          strength-based approach when working with these individuals, couples
          and families. In addition to having a private practice in New York
          City, seeing a wide range of diverse populations, Silvia has extensive
          experience working in community mental health clinics, small
          psychotherapy group practices, and large medical settings.
